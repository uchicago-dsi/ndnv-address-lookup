# Known gaps

What this app cannot tell you, and why. Read before describing its coverage to anyone.

Last reviewed 2026-09-02.

## Sioux County / Standing Rock has no state 911 data at all

North Dakota's NG911 dataset contains **zero of 435,480 address points and zero of 175,283 road
centerlines** for Sioux County. Not a processing loss on our side — the state does not have it.
`msag` has no rows for Fort Yates, Cannon Ball, Selfridge, Porcupine or Twin Buttes.

So the app **cannot give a Standing Rock voter their official 911 address**, which is the app's
primary purpose. That has been true since the first release (it is noted in
`uchicago-dsi/north_dakota_native_vote#35`).

Mitigated as of 2026-09-02 by the Sioux County fallback: tapping the county, or searching "Sioux
County" or "Standing Rock Reservation", opens a box with everything that *is* known — the polling
place, all drop-box and absentee-voting-day locations, the 911 coordinator to call, and driving
directions. It explains that the gap is in the state's data, not the voter's registration.

**Worth pursuing:** an address source from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe or the BIA. That would
turn the fallback into a real address lookup.

## Counties the Secretary of State has not finished entering

Re-check each of these on every refresh; they are expected to fill in before the election.

| Gap | Status 2026-09-02 |
|---|---|
| **Ransom County polling places** | WhereToVote says "not established at this time by the county". ~2,591 addresses show no polling place. Declared in `scripts/precincts-supplement.json`. |
| **Ransom County drop box** | Absent from `eid=348`. |
| **Foster and Griggs drop boxes** | Dropped after the primary with no general-election replacement. |
| **Ward County early voting** | Absent from `eid=348`, though its primary-era comment described general-election hours. |
| **Rolette County** | Published in WhereToVote but missing from the Precincts export; carried by the supplement. Delete the entry once the export is fixed. |

## Polling places are inferred for 13.5% of addresses

Only **86.5%** of addresses (376,852 of 435,480) have a polling place taken directly from
WhereToVote. The rest are inferred from location and the app labels them
**"Polling Places (inferred from location)"** rather than implying official provenance.

Two reasons an address is inferred:

1. It was never found in WhereToVote (about 11.5% historically — usually a street-name mismatch).
2. It is new since the scrape. 4,242 addresses were added between April 2025 and September 2026,
   and re-keying the old scrape onto them left 6,135 without a scraped answer.

Inference method: within each county ∩ legislative district, Voronoi areas are built around the
addresses that *were* found, and unfound addresses inherit the polling places of the area they
fall in. Simply-connected areas containing fewer than 10 attested addresses are **dropped**
rather than trusted, so some addresses get no polling place at all (3,681, most of them Ransom's).

## Two hand-imputed precincts

`scripts/step2-analyze-wheretovote.py` maps two precincts that WhereToVote returns but the
polling-place file does not list:

- `083204 → 083205` — county 08, district 32 has precincts 01, 02, 03, 05 but no 04, and all the
  others share the same polling locations.
- `320902 → 320901` — county 32, district 09 has only precinct 01.

## Location coordinates

- **`Porcupine Local District Buidling`** (Sioux County; the misspelling is the state's) is
  located to **street level, not address level**. No geocoder resolves house number 3457 on Paha
  Yamni Loop: the Census and Nominatim geocoders find nothing, OSM has no such way, and Google
  resolves only the street. The shipped coordinate is a point on Paha Yamni Loop in Porcupine
  beside the large community building at the centre of the loop — gymnasium-scale, metal-clad
  with a painted hills mural, a solar array and a large parking lot, and the only institutional
  structure among roughly twenty houses. Taken from the Google Street View camera position
  (Sep 2024 capture; the minimap confirms "Porcupine"). No sign is legible from any available
  angle, so the building's identity is inferred from context rather than confirmed.
  **Two wrong answers to avoid**, both of which a voter searching for themselves would hit:
  a Google name search returns a building in Porcupine, **South Dakota**, 350 km away; and the
  MapQuest entry for "Porcupine Local District" (`46.040379, -100.922115`, `streetAddress: null`)
  sits 24.1 km away in **Selfridge**, 256 m from the Selfridge Senior Center. The cause of the
  latter is that ZIP 58568's postal locality is Selfridge and Porcupine shares it — Google labels
  this very street "Paha Yamni Loop, Selfridge, North Dakota". Any geocoder that resolves the ZIP
  to a city lands in Selfridge. To confirm the building properly, ask the Sioux County auditor,
  (701) 854-3481.
- **Veterans Memorial Building**, Cannon Ball, is street-level rather than building-level: the
  coordinate sits on Horseshoe Rd in the right village, but house number 440 could not be
  pinpointed.
- **Solen Fire Hall**'s coordinate comes from the address interpolation; Google labels a "Fire
  Department" on Leach St about 90 m north-west. Either lands in the village.
- **Coordinates are keyed by location *name* alone.** Two locations sharing a name but not an
  address would give one of them wrong directions. No collisions exist today and
  `validate-data.py` fails if any appear. The `*-locations.json` files intentionally retain keys
  for retired locations as a cache of manually verified coordinates, which is what let twelve
  renamed locations keep their verification in September 2026.

## Address text quirks, carried through deliberately

The app shows the state's data as-is rather than cleaning it, so that what a voter copies matches
the official record.

- **Ordinal and name casing.** The upstream data has been drifting from all-caps toward mixed
  case, and the casing rule (faithful to the original recipe) turns mixed-case input into forms
  like `28Th Ave` and `Mcdougall` rather than `28th Ave` and `McDougall`. Roughly 1,500 addresses
  are affected, up from a handful. Cosmetic, and fixing it would change thousands of existing
  addresses at once — worth doing as its own reviewed change, not folded into a data refresh.
- One address has **no street name at all** (`ADDRESS` is just a number).
- `unit` contains the literal string `<Null>` on 6 rows, and values with trailing spaces.
- One `zip` is the malformed 4-digit `5885`; 16 addresses have no ZIP.
- `dropboxes.csv` has a garbled `state` column (one row reads `No`). The app never reads it.
- Some drop-box hours fields are empty, rendering a blank line.

## Coordinates are lossily compressed

`lon`/`lat` are float32 with low mantissa bits cleared: about **3 m of longitude and 5 m of
latitude** of error, chosen to let `BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT` + zstd compress. Fine for identifying a
building on a map; not survey data.

## Not offline-capable

Everything except satellite imagery loads at startup, so the app works on a spotty connection —
but satellite tiles come from Google at run time and the imagery for the whole state is ~29 GB,
so it can never be bundled. With no network the background is simply blurred.

## Served but unused (~4.4 MB)

`public/` ships files the browser never fetches: `legislative-districts.geojson`,
`polling-places.parquet`, and `fonts/Noto Sans Italic/`. Two more —
`counties-exact.gpkg` (2.0 MB) and `legislative-districts-exact.gpkg` (1.8 MB) — are genuine
build-time inputs for steps 2 and 3 and should **move out of `public/`** rather than be deleted.
Doing so would take `dist` from 18 MB to about 14 MB, closer to the ~10 MB target.

## Minor

- The drop-box section renders its hours through `{@html}` after inserting a `<br>`. The text is
  state-controlled rather than user-controlled, but it is a needless injection surface; the newer
  early-voting and Sioux sections render as plain text instead.
- The app promotes from an inline popup to a modal dialog when the content would overflow the
  viewport. Adding the Early Voting section makes that happen more often — intended, but it means
  the modal path is now the common one on phones.
